# Overview
Convert image to text
In this project, we use two ways to recognize digits from picture.
## Pytesseract 
With tesseract.py file you can detect text using pytesseract package 
##  Develop a Convolutional Neural Network From Scratch for MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification
The MNIST database of handwritten digits, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively.
